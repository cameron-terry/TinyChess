# TinyChess

TinyChess is a variation of standard chess.
It features a 4 x 6 board, and each player starts with 4 pawns, a rook, a bishop, and a knight.

Once the base functionality is finished, the next step is to incorporate a learning algorithm that learns from playing the user.
The user can then play other players or have its trained system play other trained systems.
